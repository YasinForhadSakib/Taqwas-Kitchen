            <h1>Our specility cuisines!</h1>
            <p>Come Ramadan, many Muslim households will be spending their days fasting (yes, that means no food and
                drinks!). But once dusk falls, you'll be sure to find that most households don't hold back when it comes
                to cooking meals to break their fast with. If you’re looking for a dish to make for Iftar, here are some
                great recipes you can try out!</p>
        </div>

                <h2>Beef Rendang</h2>
                <p> Beef Rendang is a dish that's well-loved by the Malay community. It's versatile too, you can switch
                    things up by using chicken or lamb instead. The beef in the rendang is best when it’s tender enough
                    to
                    be torn apart with a fork, so you can most definitely start preparing an hour before iftar and leave
                    it
                    to simmer on under a low-heat until it’s time to serve!</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Red-Cooked Chiken</h2>
                <p>Red-cooked chicken’-is
                    a tomato-based dish that not only packs a spicy punch, it’s also creamy and rich at the same time!
                    While
                    this dish uses some of the same spices of curry, the flavour and texture are nothing a like. Rub
                    turmeric
                    onto the chicken pieces and fry them before adding them into the sauce - by frying, you’re sealing
                    in
                    those chicken juices, making each bite so flavourful. We recommend serving this dish with a serving
                    of
                    rice</p>

                <h2>Ayam Taliwang</h2>
                <p>Ayam Taliwang is a grilled chicken dish that is spicy, savoury and extremely easy to make! To save
                    you time preparing for iftar, the rempah, or spice paste, can be made way beforehand so all you’ll
                    have to do is slather it on the chicken and pop it in the oven to bake. Now with the rempah settled
                    and flavours soaked in, you'll bite into an explosion of flavour.</p>
